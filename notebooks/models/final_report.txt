ENHANCED ML PIPELINE FOR TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS PREDICTION - PERU
======================================================================

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
-----------------
This enhanced pipeline successfully addresses the data quality issues
and improves prediction accuracy for traffic accidents across Peru.

KEY IMPROVEMENTS:
1. Data Recovery: Recovered lost regions by recalculating totals
2. Feature Engineering: Added temporal, regional, and COVID indicators  
3. Model Diversity: Tested multiple algorithms (GLM, RF, GBT)
4. Lima Handling: Separate treatment for extreme outlier region
5. Validation: Implemented time-series cross-validation

PERFORMANCE METRICS:
--------------------
Best Model: Random_Forest
- RMSE: 1694.83
- MAE: 622.59
- Cross-Validation Average RMSE: 4292.69

DATA QUALITY:
-------------
- Total Regions Processed: 28
- Years Covered: 2007 - 2023
- Records in Final Dataset: 405
- Train Size: 351
- Test Size: 54

RECOMMENDATIONS:
----------------
1. Continue monitoring Lima separately due to its outlier nature
2. Update model quarterly with new data
3. Consider external factors (economic indicators, weather patterns)
4. Implement alert system for unusual prediction deviations
5. Collect more granular data (monthly/weekly) for better accuracy
